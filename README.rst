A Python implementation of `HyperLogLog <http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf>`_
whose goal is to be `storage compatible <https://github.com/aggregateknowledge/hll-storage-spec>`_
with `java-hll <https://github.com/aggregateknowledge/java-hll>`_, `js-hll <https://github.com/aggregateknowledge/js-hll>`_
and `postgresql-hll <https://github.com/citusdata/postgresql-hll>`_.

**NOTE:** This is a fairly literal translation/port of `java-hll <https://github.com/aggregateknowledge/java-hll>`_
to Python. Internally, bytes are represented as Java-style bytes (-128 to 127) rather than Python-style bytes (0 to 255).
Also this implementation is quite slow: for example, in Java ``HLLSerializationTest`` takes 12 seconds to run
while in Python ``test_hll_serialization`` takes 1.5 hours to run (about 400x slower).

* Runs on: Python 2.7 and 3

Overview
---------------
See `java-hll <https://github.com/aggregateknowledge/java-hll>`_ for an overview of what HLLs are and how they work.

Usage
---------------

Hashing and adding a value to a new HLL::

    from python_hll.hll import HLL
    import mmh3
    value_to_hash = 'foo'
    hashed_value = mmh3.hash(value_to_hash)

    hll = HLL(13, 5) # log2m=13, regwidth=5
    hll.add_raw(hashed_value)

Retrieving the cardinality of an HLL::

    cardinality = hll.cardinality()

Unioning two HLLs together (and retrieving the resulting cardinality)::

    hll1 = HLL(13, 5) # log2m=13, regwidth=5
    hll2 = HLL(13, 5) # log2m=13, regwidth=5

    # ... (add values to both sets) ...

    hll1.union(hll2) # modifies hll1 to contain the union
    cardinalityUnion = hll1.cardinality()

Reading an HLL from a hex representation of
`storage specification, v1.0.0 <https://github.com/aggregateknowledge/hll-storage-spec/blob/v1.0.0/STORAGE.md>`_
(for example, retrieved from a `PostgreSQL database <https://github.com/aggregateknowledge/postgresql-hll>`_)::

    from python_hll.util import NumberUtil
    input = '\\x128D7FFFFFFFFFF6A5C420'
    hex_string = input[2:]
    hll = HLL.from_bytes(NumberUtil.from_hex(hex_string, 0, len(hex_string)))

Writing an HLL to its hex representation of
`storage specification, v1.0.0 <https://github.com/aggregateknowledge/hll-storage-spec/blob/v1.0.0/STORAGE.md>`_
(for example, to be inserted into a `PostgreSQL database <https://github.com/aggregateknowledge/postgresql-hll>`_)::

    bytes = hll.to_bytes()
    output = "\\x" + NumberUtil.to_hex(bytes, 0, len(bytes))
